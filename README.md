# Student GPA Prediction 

This Project demonstrates how to perform Multiple Linear Regression in Python, including handling of categorical variables using dummy encoding. It provides a step-by-step guide for building interpretable regression models from structured data. This model predicts the GPA of a student based on their SAT scores and whether they attended atleast 75% of the lectures at their university.

## Contents

- The 1.03.+Dummies.csv file containing the data used to fit the regression model
- The .ipynb file with the code

## Requirements

To run the notebook, install the following Python libraries:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn statsmodels
```
## How to Use
### 1. Clone the repository or navigate to the notebook location
